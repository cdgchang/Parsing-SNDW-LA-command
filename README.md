ðŸ§¾ Hex Log Parser (Streamlit App)
This is an interactive web-based application built with Streamlit. It parses and visualizes .txt Hex log files with block separation, keyword filtering, data table output, and CSV export capabilities.

ðŸ“‚ Features
âœ… Input & Filtering
Accepts full path to a .txt log file

Supports exclusion of blocks containing specified keywords (e.g., Ping, Debug)

Automatically identifies new blocks based on lines containing TimeStamp

ðŸ“Š Data Visualization
Original 4-line Raw Data

Displays parsed data block-by-block

Downloadable as parsed_output_4row.csv

2-row Format View

Automatically merges blocks of exactly 6 lines into 2 rows (combined format)

Other blocks are preserved in raw format

Downloadable as parsed_output_2row.csv

Block Statistics

Total number of parsed blocks

Number and percentage of 6-line merged blocks

Remaining raw blocks count and ratio

ðŸ§° Technical Overview
Built using Streamlit for interactive UI

Uses pandas for data manipulation and re for block parsing

Utilizes session_state to avoid re-parsing the same file

duckdb is imported for potential SQL-style queries (not active in current version)

ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Install dependencies
bash
è¤‡è£½
ç·¨è¼¯
pip install streamlit pandas duckdb
2. Launch the App
bash
è¤‡è£½
ç·¨è¼¯
streamlit run streamlit_hexparser.py
ðŸ“¥ Output Files
parsed_output_4row.csv: Raw block-parsed data table

parsed_output_2row.csv: Processed 2-row format table with merged 6-line blocks

ðŸ“Œ Notes
The log file must contain "TimeStamp" markers to separate blocks

Keyword filtering is case-insensitive and excludes any block containing the keyword

For large files, progress is shown while parsing (by bytes read)
